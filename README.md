# Biomedical-Signal-Analysis

## Overview  
**ECG-Signal-Processing** is a project focused on processing and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The main objectives include filtering raw ECG data to obtain clear waveforms and implementing a QRS detection algorithm. Additionally, the project includes a bonus task to identify potential heart pathologies based on signal characteristics.  

## Features  
- Preprocessing and filtering of ECG signals  
- Implementation of a QRS detection algorithm  
- Visualization of ECG waveforms  
- Identification of potential heart pathologies (bonus)  

## Technologies  
- **Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, BioSPPy
